# 🏗️ System Design – Introduction

System Design is the process of **planning, structuring, and defining the architecture of a software system**.  
It transforms **user requirements into a detailed blueprint** that guides development and implementation.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Build scalable, maintainable, secure, and high-performance systems.

## 🧠 What is System Design?

System Design focuses on:
- Translating business needs into technical solutions
- Structuring components for long-term scalability
- Ensuring performance, security, and reliability
- Creating a maintainable and extensible architecture

It bridges the gap between **requirements** and **implementation**.

## 🆚 High Level Design (HLD) vs Low Level Design (LLD)

![Difference between HLD and LLD](difference.webp)

| Aspect | High Level Design (HLD) | Low Level Design (LLD) |
|------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Focus | Overall system architecture | Detailed component logic |
| Scope | Services, databases, APIs | Classes, methods, algorithms |
| Audience | Architects, stakeholders | Developers |
| Output | Architecture diagrams | Class diagrams, code flow |
| Detail Level | Abstract | Highly detailed |

## 🚀 Steps to Get Started with System Design

![System Design Steps](system_design22.webp)

### 1️⃣ Understand Requirements
- Gather business and user needs
- Talk to stakeholders
- Review documentation and constraints

### 2️⃣ Define Architecture
- Identify core components (services, APIs, databases)
- Decide communication patterns

### 3️⃣ Choose Tech Stack
- Programming languages
- Databases (SQL / NoSQL)
- Frameworks & tools

### 4️⃣ Design Modules
- Break system into independent modules
- Define responsibilities and data flow

### 5️⃣ Plan for Scalability
- Handle increased traffic
- Remove bottlenecks
- Design for horizontal & vertical scaling

### 6️⃣ Ensure Security & Privacy
- Authentication & authorization
- Encryption & data protection
- Secure APIs and storage

### 7️⃣ Test & Validate
- Write test cases
- Simulate real-world scenarios
- Validate performance and reliability

## ⚠️ Key Factors to Consider in System Design

### 📈 Scalability
Design to handle increasing users, traffic, and data without performance degradation.

### ⚡ Performance
Ensure low latency, fast response times, and optimized resource usage.

### 🛡️ Reliability
The system should be highly available with minimal downtime and fault tolerance.

### 🔐 Security
Protect against unauthorized access and data breaches using secure practices.

### 🔧 Maintainability
Code should be modular, readable, and easy to update with proper documentation.

### 🔄 Interoperability
Ensure smooth interaction with other systems through clear APIs and protocols.

### 🎨 Usability
Provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface for better user experience.

### 💰 Cost-Effectiveness
Balance performance and scalability while keeping development and operational costs low.
